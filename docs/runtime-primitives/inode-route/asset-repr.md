1. Asset Types (analogous to file types):
   - Modeled after the document's discussion of Real World Assets (RWA)
   - Includes physical and digital asset types
   - Supports flags for transferability, divisibility, and regulatory status

2. Metadata Fields:
   - Captures ownership (similar to uid/gid in inode)
   - Tracks creation, transfer, and verification times
   - Includes references to schemas, profiles, and authorizations

3. Flags and Status:
   - Represents asset lifecycle and compliance states
   - Allows for tokenization, locking, verification flags

4. Network and Transfer Metadata:
   - Reflects the cross-network transfer concepts in the original document
   - Tracks origin network and permitted transfer networks

5. Cryptographic Integrity:
   - Includes signature field for record verification
   - Supports the document's emphasis on verifiable, signed records

Key differences from traditional inode:
- Value-centric instead of storage-centric
- More extensive metadata about asset origin and transferability
- Explicit support for fractional ownership
- Compliance and regulatory metadata

The accompanying `asset_registry` structure provides a way to manage these asset records, similar to how a filesystem superblock manages inodes.
